         <h3>Ranking of countries with Corona injuries around the world</h3>
          <P>The United States leads the world in terms of the number of infections, followed by India, then Brazil, France, Turkey, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, Poland, Iran and Mexico
            China leads the world in terms of the number of doses given, followed by the United States, the European Union, India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Mexico, Indonesia and Russia.         
            The number of doses administered does not reflect the proportion of vaccinated people in the population, given the countries' variation in population.          
            It should be noted that there are a number of agencies that provide aggregate data on Corona around the world, and there may be some differences between them.         
            The “Covid-19” pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean has claimed more than one million people since the Corona virus began spreading in the world a year and a half ago, at a time when the International Monetary Fund proposed a $ 50 billion aid plan to strengthen vaccination campaigns and stop the outbreak of the epidemic.

                    Facebook's decision to block access to some academics researching political ads and disinformation has been criticised by UK and US politicians.<br>

                    Damian Collins MP accused Facebook of shutting down legitimate research to protect its own interests.
                    And Senate committee chairmen Ron Wyden and Mark Warner also spoke out.
                    Facebook has accused researchers from New York University's Cybersecurity for Democracy team of collecting user data without consent.
                    On Tuesday, the social network disabled their accounts and blocked access to the platform, saying the team's Ad Observer browser extension breached its policies.
                    The team's project asks people to install the extension, which then enables them to share information with researchers about the Facebook ads they see.
                    Cybersecurity for Democracy projects have included research into misleading political ads, right-wing misinformation and false claims about vaccines and Covid-19.
                    But Facebook's product management director Mike Clark blogged that research should not happen at the expense of people's privacy, and said they had violated the company's terms of service.
                    "The researchers gathered data by creating a browser extension that was programmed to evade our detection systems and scrape data such as user names, ads, links to user profiles... some of which is not publicly viewable on the platform."
                    He said the company had tried for months to provide the researchers with the access they had asked for in a "privacy-protected way".
                    According to Facebook, the browser extension collected information about the publisher of each ad without their consent, including at least their first and last names, user name, Facebook ID, and link to profile photo.
                    The academics maintain that all they collect is data on advertisements.Following Facebook's decision, they have attracted influential political support.

                    Mozilla, the company behind the Firefox browser, has also blogged in support of the researchers.
                    It said it had reviewed the code in the Ad Observer extension, adding: "It collects ads, targeting parameters and metadata associated with the ads.
                    "It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers".
