    <P>The global situation after the Second World War (1939-1945), which was characterized by bipolarity (the Cold War), helped the New Constitutional Free Party to consolidate its position on the Walesian points, especially the right of peoples to self-determination against France, which had become a weak colonial power retreating from the war like England. Although France promised the party independence in 1952, it broke the promise, which resulted in the armed revolution in 1954, which made France go to negotiations in 1955, in which the government of Mendes France approved internal independence, which was opposed by Saleh Ben Youssef, who considered it a step backward and then complete independence in 1956, which saw some opposition from the far right and supporters of France.
